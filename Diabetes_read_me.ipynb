    "## üöÄ **Project Overview**\n",
    "This project leverages data from the **Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)** to explore how health indicators can predict diabetes diagnoses. By combining epidemiological insights with machine learning techniques, we aim to identify the most influential features for diabetes prediction, test model performances, and assess their utility on both balanced and imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is not just prediction but also to improve understanding of how certain health indicators interplay with diabetes risk, helping public health officials and clinicians make data-driven decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üí° **Hypothesis**\n",
    "As an epidemiologist, I hypothesize that the combination of specific health indicators within the BRFSS dataset elicits greater predictive power for identifying diabetes cases in a population. By combining variables related to general health, mobility, and metabolic conditions, predictive accuracy can be significantly improved.\n",
